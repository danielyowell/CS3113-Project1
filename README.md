This project involves creating a C program to run four processes simultaneously, incrementing a `total` variable shared by each.

To run this program:

1. Download and extract the `.zip` file. 
2. In the command-line interface of your choice, navigate to the `project1` folder. This folder should contain `project1.c`.
3. Enter the command `gcc project1.c -o project1`. This will compile `project1.c` and generate the executable file as `project1`.
4. Finally, run the executable file by entering the command `./project1`.
